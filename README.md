# Stopwatch

"Lost time is never found again" - Benjamin Franklin.

Time is one of the most precious gift in anyone's life. Unfortunately, the more you have it, the more you waste. 

In order to track the lost time, this simple stopwatch was designed. 

This stop watch will give show time in the system tray when you run it from terminal. This will help you to monitor how much work you did and will also remind you that the time is flowing, don't waste it!!

# Installation

The clock can be ran on Linux OS only (as of now, will soon make it possible to run on Windows and MacOS too. Just wait for it!)

Clone the project in the desired directory.<br> 
Open the terminal in that directory.<br>
Type ~/my_stopwatch and boom!!! You are ready to go! :)<br>

NOTE: In order to show the time in system tray, you need to have System Monitor installed on your system.
